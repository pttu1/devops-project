VPC is a private cloud which is a 

We create resources in AWS and we don't want other users or accounts to have access to your resources. We create then in a specific region. And VPC spans through availability zones in that region. AZ are subnets. The data center maybe the same but VPC isolates your resources from other user's resoources. 

VPC is virtual representation of network infrastructure
Things we used to do locally, like setup server, network configuration, etc are now moved to the cloud and VPC is the representation of it.

SUBNET spans availability zones while VPC spans the whole region. 

IP Address: 

Internal IP range on VPC level
Not for outside web traffic
for comminication inside the VPC


For allowing internet connectivity to our vpc, Internet gateway connects the VPC to the outside internet. 
EC2 and other resources takes internal VPC IP address from a subnet.

We can also use FIREWALL to secure our components, controll access to our VPC and conroll access to individual server instances.

We might want to ssh into our server and do some configuration. For that we have Network Access Control List (NACL) and SG

Configure access on subnet level => NACL
Configure access on instance level => Security Group

We can use terraform apply and enter 'yes'.
We can remove resources: $terraform destroy -target <resource-name>
Use terraform apply to remove resources.
