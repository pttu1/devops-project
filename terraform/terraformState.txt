Terraform has a 'refreshing state' option when we do $terraform apply. 

In our folder, terraform.tfstate file holds the current state of our last execution. And, terraform.tfstate.backup holds the state before our current stae. 

I think we could check our ids and arns from our current state. 

We can access the state list using commands 

$terraform state

$terraform state list

$terraform state show aws_subnet.dev-subnet-1
