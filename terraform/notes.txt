Create IAM user in terraform.

Creating admin user: go to IAM -> Users -> New users -> User name (admin)
Give it both console access and programmatic access

Next, we create a group that the user can be part of and then we assign permissions to the group rather that directly to the user. 

In this case, we are going to click the permission tab and give the user administrator access. 

We create main.tf file....create aws provider and do $terraform init

It creates a terraform folder with our provider and a .lock.hcl file

Provider gives us access to provider API
