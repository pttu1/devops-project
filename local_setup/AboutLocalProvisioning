This project is a milti-tier web application that will be setup locally. 

Application services, Tomcat. Load balancers: Nginx. 

We setup locally that is automated, repeatable (IaC). So that we can do R&D locally

Tools: Hypervisor: VM VirtualBox
	Automation: Vigrant
	CLI: Git Bash
	IDE: VS Code


Objective: VM automation locally, Baseline for upcoming projects, Real world project setup locally (for R&D).


Architecture of project services: Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcached, MysQL

Archietecture of Automated setup: Vagrant, Vitualbox, Git bash, and certain scipts....See screenshot

We are going to use vigrant to automatically setup vms. It is going to communicate with virtualbox.
We'll then use some bash scripts or bash commands to set up our project services.
We'll automatically create vms for our services from vigrant. 

Flow of exec:
1. setup tools mentioned in prerequisite (dockerhub, domain name, github, etc)
2. clone the application source code
3. cd into the vagrant dir
4. Spin up vms
5. Validate 
6. Setup project services: Mysql, Memcached, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, Nginx, build and deploy
7. Verify from browser

Keep files from the repo in respective branches..

Switch to branch local-provisioning: $git checkout local-provisioning

ls the directory in the branch: ansible/ Jenkinsfile pom.xml README.md src/ vagrant/

$cd vagrant

ls...automated_provisioning/ manual_provisitioning/

Go to manual_provisitioning/ We have a vagrantfile and vagrantProfileProjectSetUp.pdf

After installing and settingup Vagrantfile....
We run $vagrant up

Next we validate.
